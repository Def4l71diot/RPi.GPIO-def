# RPi.GPIO-def
Definitions library for [RPi.GPIO](https://sourceforge.net/projects/raspberry-gpio-python/), no implementation(used only for IntelliSense)

# Why you should use this?
If you like to develop in IDEs like PyCharm you would like some sort of autocompletion. In order to have it, you should install [RPi.GPIO](https://sourceforge.net/projects/raspberry-gpio-python/) and PyCharm will do it's magic and provide autocompletion for you, but that's never that easy(especialy under Windows). By using this library, you will have it, without the frustating setup. 

### **Note**
  No implementation whatsoever. You can't use RPi.GPIO under Windows/Linux anyway, it is meant to work only on the Raspberry Pi
